# Writing a C++ Program

C++ is **strongly typed**; that is, the type of every variable is assigned when the variable is declared, and the type of a variable cannot change once the variable is declared.

A C++ program begins execution when the operating system calls the function `main()`.

**Namespaces** allow different libraries to use the same label for a class or variable because they can each define a unique namespace to differentiate them when they are used together in a program.
